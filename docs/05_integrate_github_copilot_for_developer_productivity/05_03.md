# Task 03 - Use GitHub Copilot to create a Chatbot

## Introduction

Zava would like for the Zava Storefront solution to include a Chatbot to allow its customers to inquire about products and pricing. To get this moving forward they would like to see what their developers can get started with Copilot.

## Description

In this task you will use Copilot to create an issue to create a Chatbot feature for the Zava Storefront and implement the feature.

## Success Criteria

- The application has a new Chat page that is connected to an existing Azure AI Foundry model

## Key Tasks

### 01: Create an Issue to describe the Chatbot feature

Launch GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code to begin creating the chatbot feature issue.

1. From Visual Studio Code, launch Copilot Chat:

</details>

### 02: Set the Copilot Chat context

Set the Copilot Chat context to both the `/src` and `/infra` directories so Copilot has access to the relevant code and infrastructure files.

1. Set the context to the `/src` and `/infra` directories. You can click the attachment icon in the chat window and select from the dropdown list Files & Folders, then `src`. Do that again for `infra`.

### 03: Create a GitHub issue with Copilot in Chat

Use the `/create-issue` command in Copilot Chat to generate a GitHub issue describing the chatbot feature requirements.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. In the chat window type `/create-issue ` followed by your prompt text. In this case you want to prompt indicating you want to add a new feature, for example:

    ```text
    /create-issue Add a new feature:
    - Add a simple chat functionality as a separate page that will send a text to an Azure AI Foundry endpoint and will add the result to an existing text area.
    - Configure this feature to use the Phi4 endpoint that is already deployed
    ```

2. This will trigger actions that will look something like this:

    ![Create Issue](../../media/0503_code_copilot_issue_creation.png)

3. Once Copilot is done, you will see a response similar to this:

    ![Issue Created](../../media/0503_code_copilot_issue_created.png)

</details>

### 04: Create the feature with Copilot in Chat

Use Copilot Chat to implement the issue you created, allowing Copilot to analyze the solution and propose changes to add the chatbot feature.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. From the chat window create a prompt to implement the issue, for example:

    ```text
    @workspace implement issue #<your_issue_number>
    ```

    > **NOTE** You can also prompt immediately after you create the issue with a prompt similar to this: `@workspace implement this issue`.

2. Copilot will start analyzing the solution and propose changes that are necessary to implement the feature, for example:

    ![Proposed Changes](../../media/0503_code_copilot_implement_issue.png)

3. Once you have reviewed the proposed changes, you can instruct Copilot to accept the changes using a prompt similar to this:

    ```text
    Execute the proposed changes
    ```

4. Copilot will begin updating the solution and ask for your approval for each change:

    ![Copilot allow changes](../../media/0503_code_copilot_allow.png)

5. After all the changes are approved, you will see a response similar to this:

    ![Report](../../media/0503_code_copilot_result.png)

6. If you agree with the changes, select Keep. This will save the updated files locally for you.

</details>

### 05: Compile and run the updated solution

Build the solution and configure it to use your previously deployed Phi-4 model from Azure AI Foundry.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Build the solution to make sure that everything works.

2. To run the application, you will have to configure it to use your previously deployed Phi-4 model. One of the files generated by Copilot during the implementation step contains the setup instructions:

    ![Setup](../../media/0503_code_copilot_setup.png)

3. The instructions will look something similar to this:

    ![Setup instructions](../../media/0503_code_copilot_setup_instructions.png)

4. To configure the application, you can either update those files to include your AI Foundry deployment configuration, define those as dotnet user-secrets, or as environment variables.

</details>

### 06: Commit the changes

Commit the chatbot feature code to your current branch after verifying the solution works correctly.

<details markdown="block">

1. If the solution is working as expected, commit the code to your current branch.

</details>

## Summary

You've completed this task. The application has a new Chat page that is connected to an existing Azure AI Foundry model.
